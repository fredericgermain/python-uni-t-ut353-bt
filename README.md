# python-uni-t-ut353-bt
Read noise levels measured by the UNI-T UT353 BT device via python

This is a simple, quick and dirty, python script that reads the UNI-T UT353 BT
noise meter via bluetooth low energy and sends the values to an OpenTSDB database.

If you want to make it nice (i.e. by refactoring it into a library), please make a pull request !
